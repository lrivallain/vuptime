This blog is maintained by **Ludovic Rivallain** : [**lri.ovh**](https://lri.ovh).

I am currently senior Virtualisation Engineer+SysAdmin in **[SII Group](http://www.groupe-sii.com)**, a French IT
consulting company. Before that I used to work as tech leader of run/operations team of the Private Cloud offer at
OVH hosting company.

I work mainly on **VMware** virtual infrastructures, "IaaS/PaaS" cloud computing offers for key accounts
(architecture, orchestration, disaster recovery plans, trainingsâ€¦).

And as I might be a little lazy sometimes, I love automation concepts and I deal with **Python**, **Powershell**
and **Bash** scripts daily.
