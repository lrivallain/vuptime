If you need to get a view on authentication attemps on an ESXi and to order by IP address and attemps counts:

```bash
grep -Eo "Connection from [^ ]* " $(ls -rt /var/log/auth.*) | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

And you will get something like:

```bash
156 172.16.25.23
16 172.16.25.32
1 172.16.52.2
```
