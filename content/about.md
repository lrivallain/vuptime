## Authors

### Ludovic Rivallain {#lrivallain}

I am currently senior Virtualisation Engineer in **[SII Group](http://www.groupe-sii.com)**, a French IT consulting company. Before that I used to work as tech leader of SRE (run/operations) team of the Private Cloud offer at **OVH** hosting company.

I work mainly on **VMware** based virtual infrastructures, "IaaS/PaaS" cloud computing offers for key accounts
(architecture, automation and orchestration, disaster recovery plans, trainings…).

And as I might be a little lazy sometimes, I love automation concepts and I deal with **Python**, **Powershell**
and/or **Bash** scripts daily.

My **resume**: [**ludovic.rivallain.fr**](https://ludovic.rivallain.fr)

#### Open source

I'm also self-interested in open-source solutions like **#Docker**, **#OpenStack**, **#Ansible**…
