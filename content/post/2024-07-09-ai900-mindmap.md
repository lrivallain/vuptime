As I prepared for the [AI-900 exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/ai-900t00) exam, 
I developed a mindmap to solidify my grasp of the essential concepts. I believe it could be beneficial 
to others, so I've decided to share it.

The mindmap, crafted using [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/), is Markdown-based, offering a dynamic 
and customizable way to visualize information. The simplicity of its syntax allows for a range of 
personalization options to suit any preference.

You can access the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/lrivallain/ai-900-mindmap) and view the 
mindmap in full screen at [vupti.me/ai900-mm](https://vupti.me/ai900-mm) for an interactive experience.
