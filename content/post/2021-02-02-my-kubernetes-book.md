I recently started my journey to the Kubernetes world, switching from theory knowledge to practical use-cases for customers.

This is a wonderful new technical area to discover with a lot of **new**:

* Tools
* Features/Capabilities
* Documenations
* Communities
* Best-practices
* â€¦

Of course, I am far-far-away to master those new competencies but I learn more and more on a daily basis.

At the begining, I started a small wiki for my own usage to keep some useful commands, tips, how-to documentations. But I know think that this content may help others to centralize some re-usable content.

So I started a new side project to this blog: **My Kubernetes Book**: [https://k8s-book.vupti.me/](https://k8s-book.vupti.me/)

{{< figure src="/images/my-k8s-book.png" title="Screenshot of My Kubernetes Book" >}}

> This is not a substitution to official projects documentation, just a quick way for me to get the information I need.

## Content

Currently, the '*book*' content is the following:
