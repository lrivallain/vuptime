Powershell is a very usefull tool when you have to work on a Windows operating system. It help's a lot in automation of recurring tasks and provide an easy way to extract informations in custom format. But the default powershell command window is very very... ugly...

Here are some customizations I do when I need to use Powershell from a Windows OS:

* Font: Consolas
* Font Size : 12pt
* Window size: 120c*50
* Buffer size: 120c*3000 (at least)
* Colors:
  * Text: 238;237;240
  * Background: 50;50;50
  * Others: unchanged
